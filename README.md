# Catch_Ball_Game

The game is developed using Python and Tkinter.

The game is very simple. There is one bar at the bottom of game window which can be moved left or right using the buttons that are in the game window. The ball will continuously fall from top to bottom and can start from any random x-axis distance. The task is to bring that bar to a suitable location by moving left or right so that the red ball will fall on that bar(catch the ball onto the bar) not on the ground. 

If the player catches the ball onto the bar then score will increase and that ball will disappear. 

If the player misses the ball, the player will lose the game.
